### Coding-Agent Harness Patterns

# Coding-Agent Harness Patterns

## Purpose
Synthesize practical harness patterns for coding-agent workflows using the KB's control vocabulary plus a concrete real-world operator example.

## Core claim
A coding-agent workflow becomes harness engineering when quality and reliability depend on the surrounding artifacts, controls, and review loops rather than on the model prompt alone.

## Pattern 1. Plan as handoff artifact
Use a session-scoped plan file such as `plan.md` as a durable handoff contract.

Why it matters:
- makes intent inspectable
- supports context resets and reviewer alignment
- creates a stable object for verifier agents to critique

## Pattern 2. Verifier split without full multi-agent overhead
Use heavy thinking for hard, bounded reasoning: spawn independent temporary thinkers, then have one deliberator critique and synthesize their outputs.

Use a second agent or model mainly for plan review or implementation review instead of duplicating the whole execution role.

Why it matters:
- captures evaluator benefits cheaply
- reduces self-evaluation bias
- preserves a simple operator mental model

## Pattern 3. Environment bootstrapping before task work
Prepare a runnable repository baseline before asking an agent to solve future coding tasks.

Why it matters:
- prevents setup failures from consuming the task budget
- gives tests, linters, and smoke commands a meaningful starting point
- makes training/evaluation reward signals less likely to collapse because the environment itself is broken

## Pattern 4. Cheap deterministic checks on every step
Use end-to-end tests as behavioral contracts when rebuilds and rewrites become cheap.

Run lint, hooks, pre-commit checks, and tests as close to implementation as possible.

Why it matters:
- moves error detection left
- reduces reviewer burden
- turns conventions into usable signals for the agent

## Pattern 5. Progress visibility through lightweight artifacts
Use task lists as a practical progress log when a heavier schema is unnecessary.

## Pattern 5a. Keep specs synchronized with code and tests
Treat specs as living intent artifacts. Update them as implementation reveals decisions, rather than freezing them before coding begins.

Why it matters:
- supports continuation across sessions
- lowers the cost of staying synchronized
- helps both humans and agents judge what is done versus pending

## Pattern 6. Extend the harness beyond local execution
Continue the loop through commit, push, PR creation, autofix, and automated review routines.

Heartbeat-style monitors extend this further: the harnes

### Agent Harness Landscape

# Agent Harness Landscape

## Purpose
This map connects the emerging idea of harness engineering across several sources and shows how it fits into the broader LLM agents knowledge base.

## Core thesis
Agent performance is not just a function of the model. It depends heavily on the harness: the repository structure, controls, artifacts, tests, review loops, and orchestration patterns around the model.

## Comparison axes

### OpenAI
- Focus: repository design, machine-enforced invariants, agent-recognizable context, continuous cleanup, and cross-agent review / delegation
- Distinctive emphasis: docs as map, custom linters, structured plans, architecture constraints, review loops, interoperable agent tooling, and explicit model-tier routing via subagents
- Main contribution: shows harness engineering as both a production engineering discipline and a composable ecosystem where one agent can check or extend a

# Multi-Agent Orchestration

## Definition
The deliberate assignment of different roles or subtasks to multiple cooperating agents within a larger workflow.

## Why It Matters
Some tasks benefit from separating planning, generation, evaluation, and execution rather than asking one agent to do everything.

# Harness Engineering

## Definition
The design of the environment, artifacts, controls, tooling, and feedback loops around an agent so that it can produce more reliable results over time.

## Why It Matters
As agents become more capable, performance depends less on the model alone and more on the structure that surrounds it.
